# ⚛️ Unity SDF 3D renderer

## 🔍 Overview

This project contains the Unity-based 3D molecular renderer used in the ChemSolve mobile application.

The renderer receives molecular data in SDF (Structure Data File) format from the Android client and reconstructs the molecular structure in real time using dynamically generated geometry.

This repository focuses exclusively on:
* Molecular visualization
* Runtime structure generation
* SDF parsing and interpretation
* Atom and bond rendering

The Android application and backend inference pipeline are located in the main ChemSolve repository.

## 🎬 Demo

The renderer dynamically updates the molecular structure whenever a new SDF file is received from the mobile application.
